# Helix Engine
Source code for Insight Interactive's proprietary game engine.

## Getting Started
1. Download Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 Community IDEs. VS2022 is used for everyday development and VS2019 is used to compile third-party libraries (See step 4). Make sure they are installed in their default locations.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the batch file `GenerateProjects.bat` to generate projects for Visual Studio.
4. Run the batch file 'BuildThirdPartyLibraries.bat' to compile third party libraries. This may take awhile.
5. Run `HelixEngine.sln` and set `Engine` as the default startup project.
6. Set the desired platform and configuration, build and run.
